      <p>Founded in 2025, mixi started as a simple idea: that feeling good should be accessible, delicious, and rooted in nature. What began as a small dream quickly grew into a space where people can reconnect with real ingredients and real nourishment. We opened our doors with one mission in mind—help our community fuel their days with clean, vibrant energy.</p>
      <p>As a small business, we put our heart into every smoothie we make. We get our fruits, vegetables, and superfoods from local farms that support both the body and the mind. No artificial flavors, no shortcuts—just honest ingredients blended with intention. We believe that wellness is built from the inside out, and every recipe reflects that philosophy.</p>
      <p>Our shop was created for anyone who wants to feel their best, whether they’re boosting their morning, recovering after a workout, or simply treating themselves to something refreshing and wholesome. We focus on balance, nourishment, and flavor, crafting each smoothie to bring out the natural goodness of every ingredient.</p>
      <p>More than just a smoothie shop, we’re a small, community-centered business committed to helping people feel good every day. We’re proud to be part of the growing movement toward healthier living, and we’re grateful for everyone who walks through our doors. Here, wellness meets warmth—and every sip is a reminder that taking care of yourself can be deliciously simple.</p>
